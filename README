This is meant to build a SQL data base from the given tabbed-separated
voter data ( download from http://flvoters.com/downloads.html ).

The program will accept the data from stdin, so a normal process to
get your sqlite3 database is as follows:

(1) clone this repo

(2) download tab separated voter registration data

(3) put your sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h files in the sqlite3 directory,
or alternatively use the tarball that is in this repo

(4) compile with `make`

(5) $ cat /path/to/voter_data/*.txt | ./main.run voters.db3

(6) analyze data with $ sqlite3 voters.db3, or your favorite sqlite
compatible software

note: the pre_init.sql and post_init.sql files run before and after
the data is read from stdin, you can modify them if you wish! They
create the table (pre init) and the indices (post init).
